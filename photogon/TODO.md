- [x] Include light rotation
  - [ ] Sunlight is included via an extra light scene that is merged with the loaded scene. I could not find an easier way (with the current version of the API) like only adding a light, modifying lights in a scene etc...
    - (SceneParser, SceneProperty, ... all do not have constructors)
- [ ] Include different configurations for isotropic, anisotropic etc. and number of samples
- [ ] Include FilmSize change in config
- [ ] Currently BRDF always takes ONLY first channel into account
- [x] phi: -180 to 180, currently: 0 - 360. However, should work. Still try changing
  - [ ] Tried, did not change anything. tekari still cant visualize the sampled grid. Fails at triangulating
- [ ] Include option to continue sampling from where content of file ends
  - [x] Implemented for replicating grid
    - [ ] Not exactly pretty, might want to rewrite
  - [ ] Implement for sample_grid
